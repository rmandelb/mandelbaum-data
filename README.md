This repository contains data from figures and tables in journal
articles by Rachel Mandelbaum.  The data are provided in
machine-readable format, with separate directories for different
papers.  Within the directory for a given paper, there are
subdirectories for each figure for which I have received data
requests.  There are also README files describing the data file
formats.

To request additional data or ask questions, please open an issue on
this GitHub page, or e-mail me directly.
